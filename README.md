# legendtoc.js

Legend & Table of Contents tool built for use with the [ESRI JavaScript
API].

I wrote this tool in CoffeeScript, but the compiled JavaScript files are
also included. This tool is dependent on [Backbone.js] and [Twitter
Bootstrap]. It works well in a desktop browser environment, but not well
suited for a mobile solution. The included css file does most of the
nested menu magic. I included an example application to demonstrate how
to use this tool.

This was something I've been using in-house and has worked out well, so
I thought I would share.
